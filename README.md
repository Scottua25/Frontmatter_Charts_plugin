# Frontmatter Charts Plugin for Obsidian

This plugin visualizes your YAML frontmatter data as dynamic charts — perfect for tracking nutrition, habits, symptoms, and more directly inside your notes.

## ✨ Features

- 📊 **Per-note YAML field scanning** — automatically detects frontmatter fields in a selected folder.
- 🗂️ **Multiple heatmap types** — define as many charts as you want, each with its own folder, fields, and layout.
- 🎨 **Visual customization** — choose Plotly colorscales, reverse the gradient, set font size/color, margins, and background.
- 📆 **Limit date range** — restrict each chart to show only recent days.
- ✅ **Target-based value scaling** — shows percent of target value per yaml property.
- ❌ **Over-limit cell markers** — optionally show an “X” in cells exceeding 100%.
- 🔍 **Collapsible field settings** — toggle detailed frontmatter field config with target inputs.
- 💾 **Persistent settings** — plugin settings survive restarts and reloads.
